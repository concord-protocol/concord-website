A Channel is one message plane inside a Community: *defined* in the Control Plane, but carrying its own chat on an independent Chat Plane (CORD-02). A Community is simply a set of Channels unified under a common Control Plane.

Channels come in two kinds, differing only in *who* may read them:

**Public**: readable by every member. Its key is *derived* from the `community_root`, so nothing is ever delivered and it rotates for free whenever the base does.

**Private**: readable only by granted role-holders. Its key is an *independent* random secret, delivered on grant and rekeyed on removal (CORD-06).

----

## 1. Keying

Every Channel is addressed and encrypted through the one `group_key` derivation (CORD-02); only its *secret* and *epoch* differ by kind:
```
Public  channel_pk = group_key("concord/channel", community_root, channel_id, root_epoch).pk
Private channel_pk = group_key("concord/channel", channel_key,    channel_id, channel_epoch).pk
```
Because `channel_id` is folded into the derivation, every Channel gets its own distinct address regardless of which secret feeds it. A Public Channel is just "a Channel whose key derives from the `community_root`", not a separate mechanism.

A Public Channel needs no key generation or distribution — every member can derive it, it adds nothing to an invite, and a single Refounding (CORD-06) severs it along with the base. A Private Channel needs real independence (a leaked channel key exposes only that one Channel, and it rotates independently), so it carries its own key and its own epoch.

## 2. Metadata

A Channel is *defined* by a **ChannelMetadata** entity in the Control Plane (CORD-04), holding its `channel_id`, name, and `private` flag. Every Channel is callable — a call is simply started in it (CORD-07), so there is no per-Channel voice flag. Edits fold as versioned editions like any control state, so a rename or visibility change is an authorized, convergent edit rather than a new Channel. The edition's content (the `channel_id` is the edition's `eid`, CORD-04), plus the optional client-extensible `custom` object (CORD-02 §6):
```jsonc
{ "name": "general", "private": false }                  // name ≤ 64 bytes, the protocol-wide cap (CORD-04)
{ "name": "lounge",  "private": false }                  // any Channel is callable (CORD-07)
{ "name": "discussions", "private": false, "view": "forum" }   // thread-first presentation (below)
```

**View.** The optional `view` field tells a client how to *open* the Channel: `"chat"` (the default when absent) or `"forum"`. It is a presentation hint only. Every Channel is one Chat Plane, keyed, addressed, and folded identically (§1, §3) whatever its `view`, so the field changes nothing on the wire and no derivation. A `"forum"` Channel opens thread-first: a feed of titled posts (§3), each opening onto its thread, with the plain timeline still available as an alternate view.

A client MUST render an unknown or unimplemented `view` value as `"chat"` rather than reject the edition, so new values can be added without breaking older clients. A client MUST preserve `view` on every edition it publishes, as with any field it does not act on (CORD-02 §6), so a rename from a chat-only client cannot revert a forum to chat. `view` is a protocol field, not a `custom` key; client-specific presentation preferences belong under a prefixed `custom` key (CORD-02 §6), where other clients ignore them.

A Channel is *created* by minting a random 32-byte `channel_id` and publishing this entity's first edition (`MANAGE_CHANNELS`, the owner at genesis); a Private one mints and delivers its independent key alongside. A Channel is *deleted* by an edition setting `"deleted": true`. Deletion is terminal: the id is never reused, clients drop the Channel from display and may discard its keys. Its history stays decryptable to anyone who already held them — deletion, like privatising, can't unshare the past.

Converting a Public Channel to Private is a key rotation: the Channel mints its own independent key at the **next channel_epoch** (monotonic, never resetting — the first privatisation is epoch 1 and each later one climbs), delivers it to the desired role-holders, and flips its metadata flag, all as a single authorized action (`MANAGE_CHANNELS`). The `channel_id` never changes across any conversion; only the key and epoch turn over. Because the epoch only climbs, privatise → publish → privatise is safe: each private generation lives at a distinct epoch, a stale key (always a lower epoch) can never share a coordinate with the current one, and a joiner is simply handed the current `(key, epoch)` in its invite (CORD-05). Privatising protects the *future* only: pre-conversion history was written under `community_root`-derived keys every member holds, so it stays readable to all members.

Converting Private to Public reverses it: the Channel begins deriving from the `community_root` going forward, and a member joining after the switch reads only the now-public history, never the prior private messages (they never held that key).

## 3. Messages

A Channel's Chat Plane carries the ordinary append events (messages, reactions, edits, deletes), each wrapped as a Stream event (CORD-01), signed by the Channel's `group_key` and sealed to the author's real identity within:
```json
{ "kinds": [1059], "authors": ["<channel_pk per held epoch>"] }
```
Clients load a Channel newest-first and paginate backwards, querying every epoch pubkey they hold (a Public Channel across the base epochs, a Private one across its own), so history spanning a rekey stays continuous.

Concord Channels make CORD-01's binding a requirement: each message MUST commit `["channel", channel_id]` and `["epoch", n]` inside the author-signed rumor, and a receiver MUST check both strict-equal against the Channel and epoch whose key decrypted the wrap, dropping a mismatch. No member can re-wrap another's message into a different Channel or replay it across an epoch.

Concord distinguishes two ways one message references another. An **inline quote** stays a kind 9 and carries a `q` tag (NIP-C7) citing the quoted *rumor* id; it renders inline in the timeline. A **threaded reply** is a separate action — a kind 1111 comment (NIP-22) with uppercase `K`/`E`/`P` pinning the thread root and lowercase `k`/`e`/`p` the immediate parent (all rumor ids) — and renders in a thread off its root rather than as a top-level row. A reply inherits its parent's uppercase root tags verbatim, so the root stays stable at any depth. Both bind `channel`/`epoch` like any Chat rumor, and reactions, edits, and deletes target either by rumor id (their `k` tag naming `9` or `1111`). See CORD-02 Appendix B and examples §2.1–2.2.

**Titled posts.** A kind 9 message MAY carry a `["subject", <title>]` tag (NIP-14, as reused by NIP-17), making it a *titled post*: its `content` is the post body and its threaded replies (above) are its comments. In every other respect it is an ordinary Chat rumor: it binds `channel`/`epoch`/`ms`, and is edited, deleted, reacted to, quoted, and pinned (CORD-04 §7) by rumor id like any message. The `subject` MUST NOT exceed **256 bytes** of UTF-8. That is wider than the 64-byte name cap, since a title is longer than a name, but bounded so a feed row has a known worst case. A receiver truncates an over-long `subject` for display and MUST NOT drop the message because of it.

The tag marks the *message*; `view` (§2) only selects how a Channel opens. A forum view lists subject-bearing roots as its feed and all other roots in the timeline, in any Channel. A titled post in a `"chat"` Channel and an untitled message in a `"forum"` Channel are both valid and both render. A client without forum support renders a titled post as a normal message with a thread and loses nothing: the body is the `content` of a single event, and whether a message is a post depends only on the presence of the tag.
